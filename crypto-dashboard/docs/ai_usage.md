## üîß Code Modifications and Improvements

### Original AI Code vs. Final Implementation

**Example 1: Price Formatting**
```javascript
// AI Generated
const formatPrice = (price) => `$${price.toFixed(2)}`;

// Manual Enhancement
const formatCurrency = (value, currency = 'USD') => {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: currency,
    minimumFractionDigits: value < 1 ? 6 : 2,
    maximumFractionDigits: value < 1 ? 6 : 2
  }).format(value);
};
```

**Example 2: Search Implementation**
```javascript
// AI Generated
const handleSearch = (query) => {
  const filtered = coins.filter(coin => 
    coin.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
  );
  setFilteredCoins(filtered);
};

// Manual Enhancement
const debouncedSearch = debounce((query) => {
  if (query.trim() === '') {
    fetchCoins();
  } else {
    searchCoins(query);
  }
}, 300);
```
